## 🧭 Step 0 — Set Up Your Developer Presence (Before Week 1)

Before starting the FreeCodeCamp Frontend curriculum, get your foundation ready.

### ✅ Action List

1. **Update Your GitHub Profile**

   * Add a professional photo and short bio (*Frontend Developer in Training | FreeCodeCamp Full Stack Track*).
   * Pin or create a repo named `freecodecamp-frontend-journey`.
   * Add a `README.md` that explains your goals and weekly roadmap.
   * Enable **GitHub Pages** so you can publish projects as you finish each module.

2. **Set Up Your Environment**

   * Install VS Code and extensions (*Prettier, Live Server, ESLint, React Developer Tools*).
   * Create folders: `/html`, `/css`, `/js`, `/react`.
   * Initialize Git and commit every milestone — **your commits are your progress trail.**

3. **Plan Your Schedule**

   * Dedicate **2 – 3 hours daily** (~ 15 – 20 hours/week).
   * Use weekends to review and build mini projects.

✅ A solid grasp of HTML, CSS, JS, and React
✅ A foundation to continue to FreeCodeCamp’s back-end path

### 💼 Next Phase — Portfolio Build-Out

After this frontend phase, we’ll build **your developer portfolio** — a showcase site that ties together your FreeCodeCamp projects and your story as a developer.

---

### 📸 Daily Accountability & Commits

From here on out:

* **Every day** you should have a GitHub commit showing what you did.
* **Post screenshots** of your progress (UI updates, code snippets, new features).
* **Write a short caption** about what you learned that day.

> I want to see it — the commits, the screens, the growth. Keep your repo active and your streak on fire 🔥
