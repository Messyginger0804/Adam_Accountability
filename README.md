# 🚀 Adam’s Developer Improvement Plan

> This repo keeps Adam accountable and focused on real, measurable goals — from portfolio launch to full-time hire.

---

## 🎯 Phase 1 – Get Online (This Week)

✅ Deploy **current HTML/JS portfolio** (use one of the free options below):

- **GitHub Pages:** Free + easy to set up  
- **Netlify:** Free drag-and-drop deploy  
- **Vercel:** Free for static sites  

🧩 Once live:
- Add the **Live Demo link** to your portfolio repo README.
- Pin it on your GitHub profile.
- Post the link in this repo under `/progress/portfolio-launch.md`.

## ⚙️ Phase 2 – Make Projects Hire-Ready

🎯 Deploy 2–3 of your best projects:
- **Task Manager** → rename: “Productivity Tracker”
- **Star Wars API** → rename: “Star Wars Data Explorer”
- **React SBA project** → use as a starting point for your React portfolio

Include in each README:
- 🧠 Problem it solves
- 🧰 Tech stack used
- 🔗 Live demo link
- 📸 Screenshot

## 🧱 Phase 3 – Upgrade the Portfolio (React)

After Phase 1 + 2:
- Rebuild your portfolio in **React** (or Next.js)
- Deploy to **Vercel**
- Add links to all projects, resume, and contact form
